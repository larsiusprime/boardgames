This one's complicated as it's based on an existing work, [Robo Battle Pigs](http://cox-tv.com/games/mygames/robobattlepigs.html). I suppose I should give Randy Cox a call and sort out permission for an open licensing situation once and for all.

For what it's worth, the license for the additions to R.B.P. embodied in N.H.M are as follows:
