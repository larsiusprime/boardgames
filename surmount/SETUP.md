# Setup

## 1. Setup the board

For a two-player game, the board should look like this:

  ![](/surmount/images/board_2player_blank.png)
  
  Note the colored spaces on the left and right side of the board, these are the red and blue player's "home" spaces, respectively.
  
  Top 2 tiers removed for clarity:
