# Surmount

by Sean Choate and Lars Doucet

##Overview

2 or 4 players  
Playtime: ~30 minutes  
Suggested age: 10+ maybe?

##Summary

Players take turns moving blocks across a four-tiered 3D pyramid in a bid to capture their opponent's home spaces. Blocks can be stacked on either friendly or opposing pieces, and whoever controls the piece on top of a stack controls the whole stack. Should you spend time conquering the high ground? Or sneak around the low-lying edges?

This is kind of like one of those fancy-pants abstract board games suburban helicopter parents buy from Mensa catalogs so their children will become geniuses. Except this one's actually fun! Probably!
