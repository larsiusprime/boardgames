# Ninja Havoc Machines

by Sean Choate and Lars Doucet

a derivative work of [Robo Battle Pigs](http://cox-tv.com/games/mygames/robobattlepigs.html) by Randy Cox

##Overview

2 to as many players as you can cram on a standard-sized chess board  
Playtime: ~10 minutes per session  
Suggested age: 10+ maybe?  

##Summary
A game about customizable programmable robots battling to the death. All you need to play is a standard 8x8 checkers/chess board, paper & pens/pencils, and random
junk or toys you have lying around your house like bottlecaps or coins or whatever. By far the most popular board game I've ever worked on.

##Notes

Just got the super old PDF dump of the old rulebook, needs some updating. For one, don't ever bother with the teleporter, it's kind of stupid.
