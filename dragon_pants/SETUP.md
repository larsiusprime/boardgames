# Setup

## 1. Arrange the hexagonal tiles like this:

  NOTE: This game was originally prototyped by using hexagonal tiles from other games I had lying around, such as *The Settlers of Catan.* If you have such a game you can just repurpose existing hexagonal tiles to play *Dragon Pants.*

## 2. Set up the "Deck of Destiny"

  Place all "time" cards (those bearing a number with a + or - sign) into their own deck. This is the "Deck of Destiny." Select a set of time cards to include in this deck (see table below), shuffle them together, and place the deck face-down next to the board. Place all unused time cards back in the game box -- they will not be used.

   Place the time card on the table and choose a game length by placing the time status on a number square. (If this is your first time playing, we recommend using the "Standard game" deck with a game length of **10**).

  ### Standard game

 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   11  |     2 |     0 |     3 |     1 |   -10    |

  ### Volatile game

 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   10  |     3 |     1 |     3 |     3 |   -10    |

  ### Long game

 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   16  |     4 |     2 |     4 |     3 |   -20    |

 Here is an example of the time card using the standard setup, with the time status token at 10:

 *Note 1: You don't need to use the time card if you don't want, you can just keep track on a piece of paper, or assign someone to sum up the Destiny cards aloud every turn.*

 *Note 2: If you're not playing the standard game, you should note that the (negative) sum of the Deck of Destiny must not be a larger absolute number than the game length. IE, if you start the game at time 15, but the Deck of Destiny sums to only -10, it's not guaranteed that the game will end even when all cards have been drawn. But if the Deck of Destiny sums to -16, that's fine.*
