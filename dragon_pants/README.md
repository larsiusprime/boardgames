#Dragon Pants

*Alternatively, "Dragon Trousers" in the U.K. and Europe*

Designed by Megan Bednarz and Lars Doucet

##Overview

2-6 players  
Playtime: ~30 minutes  
Suggested age: 10+ maybe?

##Summary

Players take turns moving their dragons across the board, taking advantage of terrain tiles, and drawing and using power cards, all in the hopes of controlling a legendary artifact of ultimate power: a handsomely tailored and comfortably stylish pair of denim work jeans known as *The Pants*. The Pants can only be worn by one dragon at a time, but control is fleeting as it's only a matter of time until another dragon pries The Pants loose from their owner's claws. Time ticks down one card at a time whenever a dragon wearing The Pants ends their turn. The game concludes when the timer runs out, and whichever dragon happens to be wearing The Pants at that moment wins.

##Setup

1. Arrange the hexagonal tiles like this:

  NOTE: This game was originally prototyped by using hexagonal tiles from other games I had lying around, such as *The Settlers of Catan.* If you have such a game you can just repurposes existing hexagonal tiles to play *Dragon Pants.*

2. Set up the "Deck of Destiny"

  Place all "time" cards (those bearing a number with a + or - sign) into their own deck. This is the "Deck of Destiny." Select a set of time cards to include in this deck (see table below), shuffle them together, and place the deck face-down next to the board. Place all unused time cards back in the game box -- they will not be used.
  
   Place the time card on the table and place the time status marker at 0, and the time target marker on your chosen time goal. (If this is your first time playing, we recommend the "Standard game" deck and a time goal of **-10**).
  
  ###Standard game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   13  |     1 |     0 |     3 |     1 |   -10    |
 
  ###Volatile game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   10  |     3 |     1 |     3 |     3 |   -10    |
  
  ###Long game
  
 | Card type |   -1  |    -2 |    -3 |    +1 |    +2 | Deck sum |
 | --------  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------: |
 | # in deck |   16  |     4 |     2 |     4 |     3 |   -20    |

 Here is an example of the time card using the standard setup, with the time status token at 0, and the time target token at -10:

 *Advanced Note: If you're not playing the standard game, you should note that the (negative) sum of the Deck of Destiny must not be greater (ie, less negative) than the time goal. IE, if your time goal is -15, but the Deck of Destiny sums to only -10, it's not guaranteed that the game will end even when all cards have been drawn. But if the Deck of Destiny sums to -16, that's fine.*  

3. Set up the "Deck of Power"

  The rest of the cards are the "Deck of Power." Find the card labeled "The Pants" and remove it from the Deck of Power and set it aside. Shuffle the remaining cards and place the deck face-down next to the Deck of Destiny.

4. Deal initial power cards

  Deal N cards from the Deck of Power face down into a separate stack, where N is one less than the number of players. Add The Pants to this stack, then shuffle the stack and deal 1 power card to each player, face-up.

5. Place pawns in dragon dens

  Each player selects a dragon pawn and places it on their den tile.

  *Note: I usually play this game with 3 or 4 players. The 5-player variant has an obvious gap that might need to be revised. The 6-player variant is geometrically balanced but I haven't play tested much with that many people. 2 players works fine but 3-4 seems to be the sweet spot.*
