## Overview

2-6 players
Playtime: ~30 minutes
Suggested age: 10+ maybe?

## Summary

Players take turns moving their dragons across the board, taking advantage of terrain tiles, and drawing and using power cards, all in the hopes of controlling a legendary artifact of ultimate power: a handsomely tailored and comfortably stylish pair of denim work jeans known as *The Pants*. The Pants can only be worn by one dragon at a time, but control is fleeting as it's only a matter of time until another dragon pries The Pants loose from their owner's claws. Time ticks down one card at a time whenever a dragon wearing The Pants ends their turn. The game concludes when the timer runs out, and whichever dragon happens to be wearing The Pants at that moment wins.
