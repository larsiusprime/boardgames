#Do It Yourself

To do a quick-and-dirty print & play version of Dragon Pants, just head over to the [print section](https://github.com/larsiusprime/boardgames/tree/master/dragon_pants/print)
and print out board.pdf and cards.pdf on a regular desktop printer. Black & White laser printer works best, but any will do.

Then just cut the cards and board sections out along the lines, assemble the board to match the instructions, and you're ready to go!
