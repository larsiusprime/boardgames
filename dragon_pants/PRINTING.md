# Printing

## 1. Do It Yourself

To do a quick-and-dirty print & play version of Dragon Pants, just head over to the [print section](https://github.com/larsiusprime/boardgames/tree/master/dragon_pants/print)
and print out board.pdf and cards.pdf on a regular desktop printer. Black & White laser printer works best, but any will do.

Then just cut the cards and board sections out along the lines, assemble the board to match the instructions, and you're ready to go! For keeping track of time, just use a piece of paper and a pencil. For dragon pawns, use pawns from another board game, bottle caps, coins, anything really.

## 2. Do It Fancy

If you want to print high-quality cards yourself, you can use a service like [MakePlayingCards.com](http://www.makeplayingcards.com/) and use the hiqh-quality images included in this repository. You're more than free to print high quality reproductions for your own use, or for your friends, so long as you're doing it at cost. This is a non-commercially licensed product, but if you want to do a commercial production run you can contact the authors for a special license.

## [Cards](https://github.com/larsiusprime/boardgames/tree/master/dragon_pants/print/cards)

These cards are designed for 300 DPI @ poker card size (2.48" x 3.46" / 63mm x 88mm).

## [Tiles](https://github.com/larsiusprime/boardgames/tree/master/dragon_pants/print/tiles)

The hex tiles are designed for 300 DPI @ 3.25" x 3.75" / 83mm x 95mm. You can print some hex tiles using the images from this repository if you want, but honestly if you already have a board game lying around your house that uses hexagon tiles, you'll probably have a better experience just borrowing some of those. *Settlers of Catan* works great, for instance -- just use water for water tiles, mountain for mountain tiles, and the red brick zones for power tiles. For land tiles, just use the blank white backs of the hexes, and for dragon dens just use blank white hexes, or the sea ports or something.

## [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/larsiusprime/boardgames/tree/master/dragon_pants/print/misc)

You can print off the time card from the link above.
