#Power Cards

Cards can only be used on your turn, unless they're reaction cards.

| Card | Type | Use when | Effect |
| -----| ---- | --------- | -------- |
| [![Fireball](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/fireball.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/fireball.png) | Attack | You have flat-line of sight on another dragon  | the other dragon loses one of their power cards (their choice). |
| [![Shock](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/shock.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/shock.png) | Attack / Curse | You have diagonal-line of sight on another dragon | The other dragon loses one of their power cards (their choice) *and* gets sent home to their Den tile. |
| [![Poison](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/poison.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/poison.png) | Reaction vs. theft | You are bitten by another dragon, or targeted by the "tongue" card  | Nothing happens to you, *and* the other player is sent back to their Den tile instead of you, does not get to take anything from you, and must discard a card (their choice). |
| [![Amulet](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/amulet.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/amulet.png) | Reaction vs. curse | Another player uses a curse card on you  | Nothing happens to you (but the curse card used against you is spent, as is the amulet). If the curse affected more dragons than just you, nothing happens to *you*, but it still affects everybody else. |
| [![Freeze](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/freeze.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/freeze.png) | Curse | You have flat-line of sight on another player  | The other player skips their *next* turn. If they are wearing The Pants while frozen, they don't draw a Destiny card when their turn is skipped. |
| [![Banish](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/banish.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/banish.png) | Curse | Anytime on your turn | A player of your choice is sent home to their den. Line of site is not required. |
| [![Mirror](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/mirror.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/mirror.png) | Reaction vs. attack/curse | Another player uses an attack or curse card on you | Whatever was about to happen to you happens to them instead (the Fireball hits them, the Tongue steals from them and gives a card to you, etc.) If the attack or curse also affected players besides you, the original effect still happens to everyone else, but the player that attacked or cursed you gets hit with the effect that was meant for you. |
| [![Storm](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/storm.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/storm.png) | Curse | Anytime on your turn  | All other players are sent home to their Den tiles. You *may* return to your Den tile but don't have to. |
| [![Shield](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/shield.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/shield.png) | Reaction vs. attack | Another player uses an attack card on you  | Nothing happens to you (but the attack card used against you is spent, as is the shield). If the attack also affected players besides you, the original effect still happens to everybody else. |
| [![Teleport](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/teleport.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/teleport.png) | Curse | Anytime on your turn  | Trade places with another player (even if they're on a Den tile). |
| [![Tongue](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/tongue.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/tongue.png) | Theft | you have flat-line of sight on another player | You take one card (your choice) from the other player's hand and add it to your own. |
| [![Rubber Ducky](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/rubber_ducky.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/rubber_ducky.png) | Reaction vs. theft | Use when: another player tries to steal from you (either with the Tongue card, or with a bite) | The player that tried to steal has no choice but to steal the irresistible Rubber Ducky, instead of whatever else they wanted to take. |
| [![Boost](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/boost.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/boost.png) | +1 Action | Anytime on your turn | You may take one extra action this turn, and using this card does not cost one action (but the card is still spent). IE, you can spend this card and then take 3 actions this turn. |
| [![The Pants](/dragon_pants/images/cards/small/the_pants.png)](/dragon_pants/images/cards/the_pants.png) | The Pants! | N/A | This card cannot be used, but if you are holding it when time runs out, you win the game. If you have this card when your turn ends, draw a card from the Deck of Destiny. |
