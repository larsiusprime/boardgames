# Materials

You can play this game with just stuff you have lying around your house, but an "official" Dragon Pants set would
look like this:

- 6 dragon pawns
- 1 time card
- 1 time status marker
- 43 hexagonal board tiles
 - 27x of: land (blank)
 - 6x of: dragon den
 - 4x of: mountain
 - 3x of: water, power

Popular online custom card printers tend to print decks in 54 or 36 cards, so we've designed deck sizes for both variants.
The Deck of Power is always the same but the Deck of Destiny varies:

- Deck of Power: 19 cards
 - 2x of: Fireball, Shock, Shield, Freeze, Boost
 - 1x of: The Pants, Poison, Amulet, Tongue, Banish, Thunderstorm, Teleport, Rubber Ducky, Mirror

- Deck of Destiny: 29 cards (54-card variant)
 - x16 of: (-1)
 - x4 of: (-2), (+1)
 - x3 of: (+2)
 - x2 of: (-3)
 - Blank Cards x4

- Deck of Destiny: 17 cards (36-card variant)
 - x11 of: (-1)
 - x3 of: (+1)
 - x2 of: (-2)
 - x1 of: (+2)

 The larger deck size allows you to play games of varying length and volatility and throws in a few blank cards for your own use, the smaller deck size only supports the standard game.

 You should be able to print your own deck using the 300-DPI image files in this repository.
